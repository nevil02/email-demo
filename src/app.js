You will have 3 turns to steal gold on 4 points in your friend's house, and if you are unlucky, 1 of these 3 turns will have a spray - No Coin, not to mention less money.\nIf you have an animal to follow, it will dig for the last box for you, but if not, you can tap two fingers at the same time on the last two points. You will receive money in both boxes, so remember to touch both boxes at the same time.",
